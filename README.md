# RegisterSystem
		A program created to emulate elements of the
        Universityâ€™s student records system, allowing the creation of
        individual profiles incorporating name, course and attendance.
        Any data structures will follow object-orientated patterns, and
        the system should be accompanied by an appropriate class
        diagram.
